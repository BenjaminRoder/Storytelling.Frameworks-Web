# Storytelling.Frameworks-Web
## Project Details

* Single-page HTML file
* Embedded CSS (no external stylesheet required)
* Vanilla JavaScript for framework navigation and interactive step expansion
* Google Fonts integration
* No frameworks, no Node.js, no build process required.
* Storytelling Frameworks guide — built specifically for an intermediate fiction writer.

## What's inside:
Six frameworks, each with a navigation tab at the top:

* Hero's Journey — the universal myth cycle (Campbell)
* Save the Cat — beat-by-beat story architecture (Snyder)
* Story Circle — need-driven character loops (Dan Harmon)
* Three-Act Structure — the classical spine (Aristotle)
* Fichtean Curve — crisis-first, no setup, pure escalation
* Nonlinear / In Medias Res — using time as a narrative tool

For each one you get a visual flow diagram, clickable stages that reveal illustrative examples, a "Best For vs. Watch Out For" breakdown, and a writer's prompt to try.
